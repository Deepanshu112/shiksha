        <H1>Data  Structures and Algorithm</H1>
        <p>Data structures and algorithms are a critical part of a computer science education, though not something that most bootcamps graduates or self-taught people will know very well.

            This guide will serve as an introduction to data structures and algorithms, especially for those who do not have formal education in the space.
            
            Mastering data structures and algorithms are key to becoming a successful software engineer. Learn more about data structures and algorithms in this comprehensive guide.</p>
